This is a program that goes over the numbers 1 through 1000, divides them up in prime factors, and if the sum of said prime factors equals a prime number, it outputs the number.

There seem to be a lot of numbers in the output so I might want to check the validity of said output and the workings of the program. For now, the first 10 numbers outputted seem to meet the requirements.

Need to format and comment the code to improve readability.
Maybe find a more efficient way to do certain things although I'm pretty sure this does the trick already.

Moooooh. Moooh Moooh Mooooh. Moooh. Moooooooh. Mooh.
